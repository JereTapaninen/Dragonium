# Dragonium
Colorbot made in C# and for MMO games in general, and is designed especially for Windows 10 and the Metro Theme.  
This program is not made for any game in particular, but will have some ready scripts for the MMORPG Game called RuneScape, and SHOULD be used for MMOs.  
You can, in the future, create your own scripts for any game you fancy.
